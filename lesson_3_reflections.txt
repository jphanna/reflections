When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    When you want to share your work with coworkers, or collaborate on
    writing software.  It is also good for keeping a backup of your work
    remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that you know exactly what changes you are pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When
would you use one instead of another?

    A "fork" is available only on GitHub.com. It allows you to make a copy of someone elses repository into your own GitHub account.

    A "clone" command is given when you want to download a copy of your repository from GitHub to your local machine. Or if you want to create another copy of a repo on your local machine.

    A "branch" command is used when you want to create a seperate copy of the repo in which to edit, fix, or create a new feature.  This will leave the original code intact until you decide it is safe to merge them together.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?
