How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing a diff helped me see the bug by allowing me to visually compare the code that was changed in the file, instead of looking through the entire file manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to the entire history of a file would make me a more efficient programmer by allowing me to undo changes that caused problems quickly. I wouldn't have to re-write the code to the way it was when it worked previously.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros                                  Cons
    =============================         =====================================
    Commits will have full code.          Programmer may forget to commit.
    Easier to read history or log.        
    All history of commits can be
      viewed offline.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because sometimes one change in a program requires changes to many files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lets me browse through the entire commit history of the repository. git diff allows me to view the differences between two commits in that history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing that I can revert back to a state that the program worked would make me more confident to try to add features or improve code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using git to save my changes to files so I can have a history of the changes made and, so that I can revert them later if needed.
